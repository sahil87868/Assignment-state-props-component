React Components===

Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, 
Class Component=
A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

Function Component
Here is the same example as above, but created using a Function component instead.

A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand

React State===

The state is an updatable structure that is used to contain data or information about the component. The state in a component can change over time. The change in state over time can happen as a response to user action or system event. A component with the state is known as stateful components. It is the heart of the react component which determines the behavior of the component and how it will render. They are also responsible for making a component dynamic and interactive.

A state must be kept as simple as possible. It can be set by using the setState() method and calling setState() method triggers UI updates. A state represents the component's local state or information. It can only be accessed or modified inside the component or by the component directly. To set an initial state before any interaction occurs, we need to use the getInitialState() method.

React Props===
Props stand for "Properties." They are read-only components. It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. It gives a way to pass data from one component to other components. It is similar to function arguments. Props are passed to the component in the same way as arguments passed in a function.

Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component. Inside the components, we can add attributes called props. These attributes are available in the component as this.props and can be used to render dynamic data in our render method.
